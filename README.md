# Test case G2G-Online
Description: Create a frontend project that consumes an API and present the result in a table.

Duration: Until next monday

Key points:
- The frontend project should be in react. You can use the "create react app"
(https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html).
- The endpoint to be consumed should be "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts"
(https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/). You can use the fetch method to consume this Rest API.
- You can use bootstrap to beautify the frontend (the table).
- The project should be published in the GitHub (https://github.com/).

Extra points:
These points are just suggestions
- You can use the "useEffect" hook to "consume" the endpoint.
- You can use the "useState" to store the response from the API.
- You can use the "map" method to iterate the response from the API and create a table.
- Extra points if you surprise us with extra features, like: create the app in components and make communication between the components.
